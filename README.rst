dmdd
=========

dmdd is a python package that enables simple simulation and Bayesian posterior analysis
of nuclear-recoil data from dark matter direct detection experiments 
for a wide variety of scattering theories. 

dmdd has the following features:

* Calculation of the nuclear-recoil rates for a variety of scattering scenarios, including non-standard momentum-, velocity-, and spin-dependent recoil rates. All rate and response functions from rate modules directly use incorporate from `Anand et al. (2013) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6288>`_ (for non-relativistic operators, in rate_genNR and rate_NR) and `Gresham & Zurek (2014) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3739>`_ (for UV-motivated scattering models in rate_UV). 
 
* Calculation of the nuclear response functions as presented in `Anand et al. (2013) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6288>`_.
  
* Inclusion of natural abundances of isotopes for a variety of target elements: Xe, Ge, Ar, F, I, Na, He.

* Simple simulation of data (where data is a list of nuclear recoil energies) under different scattering models, including Poisson noise, following 

* Bayesian analysis (parameter estimation and model selection) of recoil data using MultiNest.
